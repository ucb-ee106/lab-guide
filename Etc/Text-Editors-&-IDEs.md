# Visual Studio Code
To quickly open the currently directory in VSCode, a very popular Integrated Development Enviroment (IDE), from the terminal we can type
```
code .
```
This will display all the files in the current directory in the file explorer on the left side of VSCode. If you would like to only open a specific file, you can type
```
code <filename>
```

# Sublime Text
If instead you would just like to open the current file in a basic text editor without all the fancy features of an IDE, you can type
```
subl <filename>
```
or for some reason you want the current directory to be displayed in the file explorer on the left side of Sublime Text, you can type
```
subl .
```
